# Video Player App 



## Description
This application was created using React, HTML CSS and Javascript. It leverages Material UI to provide a clean modern interface and axios for making API calls. The Youtube v3 api was used via RapidAPI in order to fetch data for each of the videos. 

## Getting Started
to launch the project from your own machine run the npm install command to install all the dependencies. You will also need a value for the REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY. You can get this by signing up for a free tier RapidAPI account and then searching for the documentation for the Youtube v3 api
